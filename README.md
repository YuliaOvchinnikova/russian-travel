# Project: Traveling in Russia

The goal of the project is implementing a webpage with styling and an adaptive layout of various elements and blocks.

# For this, I used CSS tools:

- clear CSS for styling;
- @media technology for an adaptive layout (for different screens: above 1280px, up to 1279px, up to 1023px and up to 767px);
- @font-face to export font;
- The BEM methodology is to organize the project's file system;

I used PixelPerfect HTML extension for perfect matching with Figma layout.
